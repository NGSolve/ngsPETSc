abstract={Starting from an abstract mathematical notion of discrete function spaces and operators, we derive a general abstraction for a large class of grid-based discretization schemes for stationary and instationary partial differential equations. Special emphasis is put on concepts for local adaptivity and parallelization with dynamic load balancing. The concepts are based on a corresponding abstract definition of a parallel and hierarchical adaptive grid given in Bastian et al. (Computing 82(2--3):103--119, 2008). Based on the abstract framework, we describe an efficient object oriented implementation of a generic interface for grid-based discretization schemes that is realized in the Dune-Fem library (http://dune.mathematik.uni-freiburg.de). By using interface classes we manage to separate functionality from data structures. Efficiency is obtained by using modern template based generic programming techniques, including static polymorphism, the engine concept, and template metaprogramming. We present numerical results for several benchmark problems and some advanced applications.},

    abstract={In this paper, the algorithms of the automatic mesh generator NETGEN are described. The domain is provided by a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). The whole task of 3D mesh generation splits into four subproblems of special point calculation, edge following, surface meshing and finally volume mesh generation. Surface and volume mesh generation are based on the advancing front method. Emphasis is given to the abstract structure of the element generation rules. Several techniques of mesh optimization are tested and quality plots are presented.},
